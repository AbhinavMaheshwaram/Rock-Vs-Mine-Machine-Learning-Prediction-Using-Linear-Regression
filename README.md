**Rock vs. Mine Classification using Sonar Data**

---

**Project Overview:**

This project aims to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data. Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation to navigate, communicate with, or detect objects underwater. By analyzing sonar readings, we can develop a model to differentiate between different types of underwater objects.

**Project Structure:**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset used in this project contains sonar readings along with labels indicating whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).
   - Data preprocessing steps involve loading the dataset, separating features and target labels, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Logistic Regression is chosen as the classification algorithm for this project due to its simplicity and interpretability.
   - The model is trained on the training dataset using logistic regression.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The trained model is evaluated using accuracy metrics on both the training and testing datasets to assess its performance.

4. **Making Predictions:**
   - The trained model is used to make predictions on new data, enabling the classification of unseen underwater objects.

5. **Visualization (Optional):**
   - Attempts were made to visualize the distribution of feature values between rocks and mines using side-by-side boxplots. However, due to technical limitations, the visualization couldn't be displayed.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - A brief summary of the project's objectives, methodologies, results, and potential areas for improvement is provided.
